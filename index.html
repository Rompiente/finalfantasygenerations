                    <p>Final Fantasy is strongly rooted in the fantasy tradition, and the game includes many magical and fantastical elements. The game and its successors also embrace the world of technology, and, consequently, the distinctive Final Fantasy universe has frequently been situated within the corresponding “steampunk” genre. In general, there is a recognizable cast of core characters or character types, such as mages (magicians) and knights, each with unique abilities. These abilities, along with an assortment of weapons and items, are used in the characteristic menu- and turn-based combat system throughout the game. As the hero and his accompanying party defeat enemies, they gain experience points and “gil” (the game world’s currency), allowing them to gain new powers and buy better equipment.
                        <br> <br> From its start as a Nintendo game available only in Japan, the series grew into an international phenomenon with a significant fan following and a robust community on the Internet. Final Fantasy’s place in the annals of video game history has been secured by its status as a classic among RPG enthusiasts and by the sheer number of its sequels, which run into double digits.

                    <p>The transition to a whole new generation of hardware is a tough move. It can either propel your series to new heights, or leave you hanging without your loyal fan base. Final Fantasy III arrived right on the cusp, after the launch of the MegaDrive (Genesis), and just ahead of the Super Famicom (Super Nintendo). Square realized that they would have to confront this reality soon, but they decided to hedge their bet and develop two games in parallel. The first, named Final Fantasy IV, would appear once again on the Famicom, while the other, Final Fantasy V, would follow not far behind on the newly launched Super Famicom. <br> <br> Even more than just the sprawling world and refined gameplay, the new technology paid dividends. While the sprites were still as tiny as ever, and Square hadn't quite mastered the finer points of a large palette, the graphics still put every 8-bit RPG to shame. Perhaps more importantly, the SNES's advanced sound hardware completely changed the tone of Uematsu's score. Where once a handful of beeps and bloops made up the entire soundtrack, the SNES could use recorded samples to mimic an orchestral score, lending a grandiose feel to the music that no RPG had achieved before. </p>

                <h2>Generation 3</h2>
                <article class="ff1">
                    <p>The first 32-bit game in the series wasn't just a turning of the page, it was a whole new beginning. Much of what was the series was buried, and new trail was blazed. It was a turning point, not just for the series, but the entire industry. Final Fantasy VII was a force that could not be ignored. Square had a long and cozy relationship with Nintendo, that few ever thought to question. When they showed off a 3D demo featuring Final Fantasy VI characters, many assumed we were getting a glimpse at the series' next incarnation. When they announced their plans to jump ship for Sony's new platform, loyal fans felt betrayed. Square was a turncoat, but they were about to win over a whole new generation of fans. <br> <br>
                        It wasn't an RPG that showed them the power of Sony's console. Capcom's Resident Evil (in turn taking a page from Alone in the Dark) combined 3D and bitmap graphics in a way that allowed for detailed, realistic environments that could never be done in real-time. The effect of using detailed CGI backgrounds was immediately apparent. When Nintendo announced that they'd be limiting themselves to cartridges, Square had no choice. The divorce was bitter, but Square made the right decision.                   </p>

                    <p>Final Fantasy X is largely considered the very first of a stream of fantastic RPGs for the PS2. Considering FF9 had little to no actual additions to the series, Final Fantasy X added perhaps the biggest thing since FF3's job system -- voice acting. The game featured hours of speech recorded for almost every character in game, which served to make the Final Fantasy experience even more cinematic. The game also boasted a significant graphical increase over the previous titles, and featured the all new sphere grid system for learning abilities. <br> <br>FF10 also allowed the player to switch party members on the fly mid-battle, but once again the player was only allowed three party members at any given time. The game was a resounding success -- the biggest since FFVII, and has built a huge fanbase of its very own. It is also the first FF title to have a direct sequel, FFX-2.</p>
